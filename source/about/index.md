I'm Matias (aka Matuu), a software engineer from Argentina.

I like music (listening and making), software libre, and blockchain/bitcoin/cryptocurrencies.

My favourite programming language is Python. I'm a member of the Python Argentina community (and also of the Civil Association). 

In my other working time I'm a teacher at the university (UTN - Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional of Argentina).

Here I write about my profession, my passion, my ideas, my hobbies. Thank you for reading.

If you want, you can write to me at my email `hi` at `matuu` dot `dev`.

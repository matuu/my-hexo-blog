I've been using [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) for a couple of years now and find it to be the most productive and customisable window manager. `i3` is a tiling window manager, which aims to organise the screen into mutually non-overlapping frames. With i3 I use [archlinux](https://archlinx.org), both give me a lot of flexibility and very fast operating system.

There are a lot of tutorial, blog entries and Youtube videos on how to configure i3. So, I'm won't explain them here. Instead, I will write a series of posts about how to set up various things related to i3, archlinx and the software I use.

In this post I share my repo with my [dot-files](https://github.com/matuu/dotfiles) where I set up i3, alacritty, tmux, and other tools.

Bye bye!
